# MachineLearning-QuizBowl

“Answering Questions about Science” is a Question-Answer challenge where given a multiple choice question about scientific concepts user has four choices, only one of which is correct. Our goal, in this project, was to apply machine learning to aid computers in answering these questions accurately.

Baseline model is based on "Cosine Distance" between Tf-Idf vectors. Integrating NLP techniques such as Stemming and N-grams coupled with External data sources such as wikipedia and Dandelion API resulted in an accuracy of 82.61%.
